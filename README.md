# skribbliocustoms
Custom words for skribl.io maintained by the A Heist Gone Wrong community.

## Structure

Each category has its own file. In each file is a comma-seperated list of custom words. Each custom word can have letters, numbers, spaces, and dashes, and must not exceed 30 characters. Each file contains ONLY the comma-sperated list, with one space after each comma, and no indents, tabs, newlines, or special characters (except the hyphen).

## Poll Requests

Poll Requests are welcome. In order for your poll request to be accepted, you must follow the rules as listed below. While anyone is allowed to submit a poll request, following the rules does not garuntee that it will get accepted.

## Issues

Issues in this repository serve two purposes: To request the addition, modification, or deletion of categories (files), and to point out formatting mistakes in files. Issues that request category changes must be specific as to what the (new) category name will be (or which one should be removed), and be explicit as to why the change is benefitial to everyone. Do not request category changes that do not serve a purpose.

## Special Categories

There are two categories that are deemed "special". The first is the "all" category, which conveniently contains ALL of the entire repository's custom words. The second category is the "random" category, which is there for any custom word that does not fit any category. Additionally, the "inside_jokes" category exists for the explicit purpose of the A Heist Gone Wrong community, and should not be used for any inside jokes that do not stem from this community.
